# unfortunately there is no separate gffread flag for a genomic sequence index;
# genome FASTA file should be accompanied by FASTA INDEX (.fai) file
# in the same directory, under the same core name; in case it is not:
# gffread will create the index on-the-fly and save it alongside the genomic sequence

# It is required by the python libraries that indices of the alignments are located in the same directory.
