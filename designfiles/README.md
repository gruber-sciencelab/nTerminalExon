# Design files used in nTerminalExon

In this folder, we provide the design files that were used to create the scTE-db dataset.

The first folder, named input_designfiles_step1_unfiltered, contains the initial design file that includes basic technical and biological information necessary to initiate the analysis. These design files are utilized in the first part of the analysis (PREPROCESSING PART).

The second folder, input_designfiles_step2_filtered, contains the final design file generated during the preprocessing step. This file incorporates samples that successfully passed the quality control filter. These updated design files were employed as input for the second step (as detailed in the general README file of this repository).

Please be aware that certain datasets have been divided into two separate design files, enabling the analysis of these samples in distinct batches.
