# Design files used in nTerminalExon

In this folder we provide the design files we used in order to create the scTE-db dataset.

In the first folder *input_designfiles_step1_unfiltered* we include the initial design file containing the basic information (technical and biological) to start the analysis. These are the design files that are going to be used in the first part of the analysis (PREPROCESSING PART).
